/**
 * Durable timer-wheel — ported from viota's packages/worker/src/do/timers.ts
 * (Wave 3, ADDENDUM J/K/L).
 *
 * The `timers(kind, seat, fire_at)` table IS the wheel (schema created in
 * Wave 1's storage.ts migration, CHECK constraint already includes
 * `'round_wait'`). The single platform Alarm is ALWAYS armed to
 * `min(fire_at)` (or cleared when the wheel is empty), so liveness is
 * structural: an Alarm persists and re-fires across eviction and redeploy,
 * and the Alarm firing IS the rehydration trigger.
 *
 * The table-mutating fns (`setTimer`/`clearTimer`/`creditEvictionGap`) are
 * pure synchronous SQL and are therefore safe to call INSIDE a
 * `transactionSync` span. Arming the PLATFORM alarm (`rearmAlarm`) awaits
 * `storage.setAlarm`, so it is a separate primitive the caller runs AFTER the
 * sync write span — never inside it (zero awaits inside a sync span). The
 * invariant "the platform alarm equals min(fire_at)" is re-established by
 * calling `rearmAlarm` at the end of every handler / alarm entry that
 * touched the wheel.
 *
 * ADDENDUM J/L deviations from viota's union: `'soft'` is DROPPED (Jaipur has
 * no legacy data to stay backward-compatible with, and viota already marks
 * it RETIRED — a connected player is never auto-covered) and `'round_wait'`
 * is ADDED (round_end liveness — see do/presence.ts's `armRoundWaitIfAbsent`
 * and game-do.ts's alarm() `round_wait` dispatch case).
